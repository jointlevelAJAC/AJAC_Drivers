By default, the QUADSPI never stops its prefetch operation, keeping the previous read operation active with nCS maintained low, even if no access to the Flash memory occurs for a long time.

When this bit remains set and the DMA is re-started by the software driver, the packets residing in the Rx Queues that were received when this RxDMA was stopped, are flushed out. The packets that are received by the MAC after the RxDMA is re-started are routed to the RxDMA. The flushing happens on the Read side of the Rx queue. When this bit is set to 0 the Ethernet peripheral does not flush the packet in the Rx queue destined to DMA Rx Channel after the DMA is stopped due to a system bus error. This might cause head-of-line blocking in the corresponding RxQueue. Note: The stopping of packet flow from a Rx DMA Channel to the application by setting RPF works only when there is one-to-one mapping of Rx Queue to Rx DMA channels. In Dynamic mapping mode, setting RPF bit in ETH_DMACRXCR register might flush packets from unintended Rx Queues which are destined to the stopped Rx DMA Channel." start="31" size="1" access="Read/Write" />
